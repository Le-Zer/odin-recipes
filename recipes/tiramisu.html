        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Tiramisu is a beloved Italian dessert made of layers of espresso-soaked ladyfingers and a luscious mascarpone-based cream, 
        dusted with cocoa. The dessert balances bold coffee and cocoa flavors with a sweet, velvety texture from whipped egg yolks and mascarpone,
        often finished with a touch of Marsala wine or coffee liqueur. It's elegant yet comforting â€” a perfect make-ahead treat for gatherings.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>300 g (10-12 oz) ladyfingers (savoiardi)</li>
            <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>100 g (1/2 cup) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>500 g (17.6 oz) mascarpone cheese</li>
            <li>300 ml strong espresso, cooled</li>
            <li>2-3 tbsp Marsala wine or coffee liqueur (optional)</li>
            <li>Cocoa powder for dusting</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make espresso and soak: Brew strong espresso and let it cool; stir in Marsala or coffee liqueur if using. Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso (do not soak) and arrange a layer in a serving dish.</li>
            <li>Prepare the cream: Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together over a bain-marie or with an electric mixer until pale and slightly thickened. Allow to cool slightly, then fold in the mascarpone until smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Layer: Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the first layer of soaked ladyfingers. Add another layer of espresso-dipped ladyfingers, then spread the remaining mascarpone mixture on top.</li>
            <li>Chill: Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight to allow flavors to meld and the dessert to set.</li>
            <li>Finish and serve: Just before serving, dust the top generously with cocoa powder. Slice and serve chilled.</li>
        </ol>
