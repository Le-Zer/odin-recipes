        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Pizza Margherita is a timeless Italian classic, celebrated for its simplicity, freshness, and 
        vibrant flavors. Originating from Naples, it is said to be named in honor of Queen Margherita of 
        Savoy, with its red tomatoes, white mozzarella, and green basil symbolizing the colors of the Italian
        flag. This pizza features a thin, chewy crust topped with tangy tomato sauce, creamy mozzarella, and 
        fragrant fresh basil, baked to perfection in a hot oven until the cheese bubbles and the crust is 
        golden. It's a dish that highlights the beauty of fresh, high-quality ingredients without the need 
        for complicated techniques.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500 g (about 4 cups) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>325 ml (1⅓ cups) warm water</li>
            <li>7 g (1 packet) active dry yeast</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil (plus extra for brushing)</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>200 g (7 oz) fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>200 g (about ¾ cup) tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the dough: In a bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water, then let it 
            rest for 5-10 minutes until foamy. Add the flour, salt, and olive oil, and knead until you 
            have a smooth, elastic dough. Cover and let rise for 1-2 hours until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven: Set your oven to its highest setting (around 250°C / 480°F) and place 
            a pizza stone or baking tray inside to heat.</li>
            <li>Shape the base: Punch down the dough, divide it into two portions, and roll each out into
            a thin circle or rectangle on a lightly floured surface.</li>
            <li>Assemble the pizza: Spread tomato sauce evenly over the dough, tear the mozzarella into 
            small pieces, and scatter it on top. Season lightly with salt and pepper, and drizzle with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Bake: Transfer the pizza to the hot stone/tray and bake for 7-10 minutes, or until the 
            crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling.</li>
            <li>Finish: Add fresh basil leaves just before serving to preserve their aroma and color.</li>
        </ol>
